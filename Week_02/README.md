## Prepare Before Reading 

- Read Chapter 2 Of *The Matrix Cookbook* and grow familiar with taking derivatives of a Matrix expression
- Watch video tutorial 1 and learn the basics of Newton's method and Gauss-Newton method
- Complete the quiz
- Video and textbook material: see the bottom

## Questions

1. **Implementation Details**
   - Derive and understand the process of linearizing a quadratic constraint. 
   - Derive and understand the process from minimizing a sum-of-square problem to solving a linear equation (hint: taking the Gradient and setting it to zero).
   - What modeling tricks does the author use to make the constraints at most quadratic?
   - What is the interactive modeling procedure with handle-based deformation?

2. **Constraint Terms**
   - Pick a specific constraint (e.g., planarity) and write down its form of Hx = r at iteration step n, make sure to match the dimensions between matrix and vector
   - How are inequality constraints modeled?
     
3. **Fairness and Regularization Terms**
   - Why is the fairness term necessary for this optimization method? How to design this term?
   - Understand the purpose of *ÏµI* in optimization (Tutorial 2 may help, starting at 25:00) 
  
4. **Discussion**
   - Read the code geometrylab/optimization/guidedprojection.py and geometrylab/optimization/guidedprojectionbase.py carefully and learn how to add iterative constraints to the model.
   - What does the mesh data structure help to define the constraint-variable relationship?
