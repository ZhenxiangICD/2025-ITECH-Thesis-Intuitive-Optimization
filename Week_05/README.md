# Week 5: Laplacian, Spectral Analysis - Shape Intrinsics
## Introduction

This week, we shift focus to foundational mathematical and geometric concepts, exploring how shapes can be described and manipulated using their intrinsic properties.

The emphasis is on the Laplacian operator and its role in applications like shape editing and geometry processing. These intrinsic descriptions of shapes are powerful tools for tasks such as interpolating, deformation, and mapping.

You will:

- Watch video tutorials to build an understanding of eigenvalues, vector spaces, and PDEs.
- Explore the Laplace operator and its applications in geometry processing.
- Read two papers: the first provides a broad overview of shape editing techniques, while the second delves into using Laplacian representations for mesh processing.
- To balance the reading load, you can alternate between papers and tutorials.

## Reading Assignment

- *A Revisit of Shape Editing Techniques: from the Geometric to the Neural Viewpoint*
  - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01694)
  - Required: Section 2.1.1 & 2.2 ; Optional: Section 3
  
- *Differential Representations for Mesh Processing*
  - [Paper](https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/Laplacian-mesh-processing/STAR/CGF-Laplacian-mesh-processing.pdf)


## Before Reading 

1. **Math Fundamentals**:
   - Go through the the tutorial videos on *eignevalues* , *vector spaces* and *PDE*

2. **Laplacian**:
   - Watch video tutorial on *The Laplace Operator*
   This tutorial will give you a in-depth introduction about the Laplace Operator, which is very important in shape analysis.
   Then you can start reading the first paper, which is more generic and require less technical barriers. If you still have troubles reading specific mathematic definitions, you can take notes and skip for now. 

3. **Spectral Geometry Processing**:
   - Watch video tutorial on *PDE and Spectral Approaches to Geometry Processing*
   This tutorial gives you more application-level introduction on how spectral and PDE analysis can be used in geometry processing, including the Laplacian operator before. Then you can read paper 2 without much hiccups since they're highly relevant.

## While Reading

1. **Overall Aims**:
   - **Core paper**: Understand how the neural network model integrated with simulation knowledge for inverse design. Focus on how the optimization process solves nested problems and where the derivatives come from.
   - **Option papers**: Learn the concept of implicitly describing a system with a governing condition.
