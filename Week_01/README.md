# Week 1: Fundamentals of Taylor Series and KKT conditions

## Reading Assignments

- **Interactive Exploration of Design Trade-Offs**
  - [Paper](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~adriana/tradeoffs/aschulz2018.pdf)

- **Pareto Gamuts: Exploratory Design for Performance Criteria**
  - [Paper](https://paretogamuts.csail.mit.edu/Pareto_Gamuts_Paper_Final.pdf)

## Prepare Before Reading

- Review the concept of derivatives, partial derivatives, and Jacobian.
- Understand the basics of Taylor Series expansion.
- Understand Lagrange multipliers and the KKT conditions.
- Video and textbook materials may be added later...

## Questions

1. **Paper structure and comparision**
   - Comparing two papers, which aspect does the second one add to the first one?
   - How does the mathematical methods in the first paper set up the second one and how to find a way to build some extension to an existing strategy?

2. **First-Order Approximation**
   - Derive some first- and second- order approximation with any Multivariable polynomial example [Link](https://mathinsight.org/taylor_polynomial_multivariable_examples)
   - How does the first-order approximation method determine the directions of movement in the design-context space?
   - How much more computational cost will be for a higher-order approximation and why didn't the author it?
     
3. **KKT Perturbation**
   - Derive some KKT conditions given a function with Multivariable and multiple constraints (equality and inequality)
   - Explain how the KKT conditions are used to form the basis for the first-order approximation in the Pareto Gamut exploration.
   - What does the author do to ensure the KKT conditions are not violated during pertubation?
  
4. **Data Structure**
   - What information does a single patch contain?
   - Expalin the performance buffer and what does it store?
