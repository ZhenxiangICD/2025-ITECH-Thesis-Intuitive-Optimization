# Week 3/4: Non-linear problems, Geometry Intrinsics

## Introduction

This session is split into two parts, one continues from the previous discussion on optimization, which will be focused on non-linear problems and more concepts and methods, including majorization minimization and augmented Lagrangian, and the other discusses the intrinsic properties of geometry, including Laplace Operator and spectral analysis method. You should finish both of them during the next two weeks, but it's up to you to decide which one to start first. 

# Part A - Non-linear optimization, Augmented Lagrangian & Coordinate Descent #

## Before Reading 

- Go through slides of *Introduction to Optimization for Simulation* and

  1.) Learn what problems elastic energy can solve in geometry processing;

  2.) Review the general methods of solving a minimization problem

  3.) Understand the three major challenges in geometry optimization and know the names of the methods to address those challenges (don't need to go deep now, you can go back and check whenever you face similar challenges) 

- Watch ONE of the video tutorials on the following algorithms and learn its key concepts. 

  a. ) Augmented Lagrangian Method (useful in updating multipliers and managing feasibilities)

  b. ) Coordinate Descent (useful in making problems simpler!)

  The paper you read depends on the algorithm you study ( of course you can do both! )

- Watch video tutorial 3 and learn the concept of majorization minimization (MM). It will teach you the basic principles of surrogating a complex function.
