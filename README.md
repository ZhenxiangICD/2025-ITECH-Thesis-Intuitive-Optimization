# 2025 ITECH Thesis - Magic Optimization
Mathematics lies in the foundation of modern computer graphics and computational design. This repository aims to use examples from classical and state-of-the-art papers to train students for improving their understanding of foundamental knowledge about multivariate calculus, linear algeaba and optimization, and understand how those techniques can be applied for design scenarios.
