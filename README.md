# 2025 ITECH Thesis - Magic Optimization
Mathematics is the foundation of modern computer graphics and computational design. This repository aims to use examples from classical and state-of-the-art papers to train students to improve their understanding of fundamental knowledge about multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and optimization and understand how those techniques can be applied to design scenarios.
